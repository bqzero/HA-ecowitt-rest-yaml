# HA-ecowitt-rest-yaml
Alternative to integrate EcoWitt Weatherstation through REST API to Home Assistant

To use this yaml example you will have to create an application and API key on the ecowitt server first.

Open https://www.ecowitt.net/home/user and go to your profil to create new keys. (see example folder for screenshots)

once you have the two keys get the mac address of your EcoWitt Gateway.

replace the placeholders in the yaml with the three values you just retrieved.
